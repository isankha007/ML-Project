    "\n",
    "The Data science project which is given here is an analysis of employee performance form INX Furture Inc. The project goal is to find the performance rating of the employees from each feature of their data such as total work experience, gender, department, current role..etc. The Goal and Insights of the project as follows,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Department wise performances\n",
    "2. Top 3 Important Factors affecting employee performance\n",
    "3. A trained model which can predict the employee performance based on factors as inputs. This will be used to hire employees\n",
    "4. Recommendations to improve the employee performance based on insights from analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given data of employees has the 1200 data to perform a higher level machine learning where it is well structured. The features present in the data are 28 in total. The Shape of the data is 1200x28. The 28 features are classified into quantitative and qualitative where 16 features are qualitative and 11 features are quantitative. The employee ID data is alphanumerical data which doesn't play a role as a relevant feature for performance rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is a complete labelled data and categorical which decides the machine learning algorithm to be used. The important aspects of the data are depending on the correlation of data between features and performance rating. The analysis of the project has gone through the stage of distribution analysis, correlation analysis and analysis by each department to satisfy the project goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning model which are used in this project are Logistic regression ,Decision Tree with GridSearchCV ,XGBoost Classifier ,Random Forest Classifier,Gradient Boosted Classifier.In those models XGBoost Classifier which predicted the nearby higher accuracy of 92%. Since it is categorical labelled data, it has to go through the classifier machine learning techniques which will be suitable for this structured data. The numerical features are the most relevant in the model according to correlation technique. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the goals of this project is to find the important feature affecting the performance rating. The important features were predicted using the machine learning model feature importance technique.  The main technique used in the preprocessing data using the one hot encoding method to convert the string-categorical data into numerical data, because, the most of machine learning methods are based on numerical methods where strings are not supportive. The overall project was performed and achieved the goals by using the machine learning model and visualization techniques. "

    "## Analysis by Visualization\n",
    "we can able to perform the analysis by the visualisation of the data in two forms here in this project. One is by distributing the data and visualize using the density plotting. The other one is nothing but the correlation method which will visualise the correlation heat map and we can able to achieve the correlation values between the numerical features. \n",

    "### (i) Distribution Plot\n",
    "In general, one of the first few steps in exploring the data would be to have a rough idea of how the features are distributed with one another. To do so, we shall invoke the familiar kdeplot function from the Seaborn plotting library. The distribution has been done by both numerical and categorical features. it will show the overall idea about the density and majority of data present in a different level.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### (ii) Correlation Plot\n",
    "The next tool in a data explorer's arsenal is that of a correlation matrix. By plotting a correlation matrix, we have a very nice overview of how the features are related to one another. For a Pandas data frame, we can conveniently use the call .corr which by default provides the Pearson Correlation values of the columns pairwise in that data frame. The correlation works bet for numerical data where we are going to use all the numerical features present in the data. \n",

    "- The Total years of experience and job level are having the higher correlation when comparing to all features.\n",

    "- People who have more experience with the company has the more probability to get the promotion from the correlation between them.\n",
